# Text Processing and Word Search Script

![tpwss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aed4b4b-23a4-43a9-993e-a01fd7c08982)

This Python script processes a given text, breaking it down into individual words, and performs a search around a specific keyword. The script demonstrates basic text manipulation and search techniques by isolating and printing the words immediately before and after a specified target word within the text.

### Features:
- **Text normalization**: Converts text to lowercase and removes punctuation for uniform processing.
- **Word isolation**: Finds and prints the word immediately preceding and following a given keyword (in this case, "study").
- **Customizable search**: The target word and text can be easily modified for different use cases.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x

### Usage:
Clone the repository and run the script in your terminal:
```bash
python text_processing.py
```

The script can be adapted to search for different words by modifying the keyword.
